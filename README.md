# nodecovering
The proposed problem was:
>Given a non-directed graph *G = (N, A)*, with *n* nodes and *q* edges, identify the set of nodes, of minimum cardinality (i.e. as small as possible), such that every edge in G is incident in at least onde node of that set.

>*Example:*

>*Graph with 9 nodes and the following edges: (1,6) (1,8) (2,3) (2,5) (2,7) (3,4) (3,6) (4,5) (4,9) (5,8) (6,7) (6,9) (7,8) (8,9)*

Let's see this graph visually:
